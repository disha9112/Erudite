<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![![Erudite Homepage][erudite-homepage]](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78133928/210550452-70aba49c-39f5-4e4d-85de-ddf2bc396c62.png)

Erudite is a video streaming and sharing app, built using the MERN stack. No matter the technology niche, users can upload and access video content under different categories. The website gives them the ability to sort through the trending videos, like them, leave comments, and follow their favourite channels too.

## Features Implemented

- Users can register or login to their account to access the features available.
- The home page fetches a list of videos, which are randomly fetched from the database. Additionally, users can search for a video by providing the title in the search bar above.
- Users can also sort through the top trending videos, those uploaded by the channels they follow, or videos under a specific tag through the side menu available.
- An aesthetic UI has been implemented with the ability to switch between light or dark themes, depending on the choice of the user.
- If users wish to upload their own video content, they can do so efficiently by making use of the create page. The content would include a thumbnail, the video file, the tech category under which the content falls, and a short description of what their video talks about.
- Individual videos can be liked, commented on, or shared by copying the URL to the clipboard.
